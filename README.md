# ForestTycoon-HampHack-2016 
## This game was built for the Hampshire College Hackathon, which happened in February 2016. Our team(Rachana, Bridget and Ellie) decided to make a game that could teach kids about the harmful affects humans are having on the environment in order to fit with the themes of the hackathon. 

## What it does
This game is similar in structure to Roller Coaster Tycoon(a popular computer game that allows users to build and manage a theme park). Players are given a piece of forest and are instructed to maintain its health (displayed in a corner bar). The forest contains 2 types of trees (pines and oaks) and deer (depicted by the cubes).   

The player's forest is threatened by man-made and natural disasters (mostly forest fires) and the player can help avert these disasters by answering multiple choice questions. Correct answers stop the calamity and give the players points to help develop their forests into an ecologically healthy environment. Incorrect answers cause the disaster to remain and thus. decrement the health of the environment. 

The player wins the game when their health percentage reaches 100% and they lose when the percentage reaches 0%.

## How we built it 
The project was largely built with the help of the Unity3D Game Development Platform. Our scripting language of choice was C# because it has many similarities to Java, a language we are all comfortable with. The 2 Windows' members wrote their scripts on the VisualStudio IDE and the 1 OSX member coded with the aid of the MonoDevelopment IDE.  

##In The End... 
We accomplished all the tasks we set out to do. Although this was not the most technologically challenging product, the game did win 2nd place for best overall functioning prototype.
